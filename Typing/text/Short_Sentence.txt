A bad workman blames his tools
A burnt child dreads the fire
A drowning man will catch at a straw
Bad news travels fast
Beggars cannot be choosers
Bitters do good to the stomach
Cut your coat according to your cloth
Blood is thicker than water
Do to others as you would be done by
Casting pearls before swine
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Easy come, easy go
Easier said than done
Everything comes to those who wait
Fine feathers make a fine bird
First come, first served
He who laughs last laughs best
Go home and kick the dog
Every cloud has a silver lining
Make hay while the sun shines
Little strokes fell great oaks
Like father, like son
Misfortune never comes single
Necessity is the mother of invention
No news is good news
One cannot eat one's cake and have it
Practice makes perfect
Pie in the sky
The child is the father of the man
I am groot
I can do this all day
Kneel before me
Bring me thanos
Sun's getting real low
Wakanda forever
I am Ironman
What is my greatest creation is you
I'm the crazy bitch around here
