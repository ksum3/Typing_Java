Matilda
It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful. Some parents go further. They become so blinded by adoration, they manage to convince themselves their child has qualities of genius. Well there's nothing wrong with all this. It's the way of the world. It's only when the parents begin telling us about the brilliance of their own revolting offspring that we start shouting "Bring us a basin, we are going to be sick." Occasionally one comes across parents who take the opposite line. Who show no interest at all in their children and these of course are far worse than the doting ones. Mr and Mrs Wormwood were two such parents. They had a son called Michael and a daughter called Matilda and the parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick it away. Mr and Mrs Wormwood looked forward enormously to the time when they could pick their little daughter off and flick her away, preferably to the next County or even further than that. It is bad enough when parents treat ordinary children as though they were scabs and bunions but it becomes somehow a lot worse when the child in question is extra-ordinary and by that I mean, sensitive and brilliant. Matilda was both of these things but above all she was brilliant. Her mind was so nimble and she was so quick to learn, that her ability should have been obvious even to the most half witted of parents. Mr and Mrs Wormwood were both so gormless and so wrapped up in their own silly little lives that they failed to notice anything unusual about their daughter. To tell the truth I doubt they would have noticed even if she had crawled into the house with a broken leg.
